For minor disease, balloon dilation is a possibility. The choice between mechanical and bioprosthetic valves requires a judgment regarding the benefits and risks of each procedure. A mechanical prosthetic valve requires lifelong anticoagulation, whereas a bioprosthetic valve tends to degenerate over a few years, with faster degeneration observed in younger patients. Objective To assess the survival outcomes, postoperative complications, and reoperation rates in patients who underwent prosthetic mechanical valve replacement with acenocoumarol and low-dose aspirin (75 mg), with adequate International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring. Methods and materials This was a retrospective study involving data from patients who underwent mechanical cardiac valve replacement between 1971 and 2022. This study adhered to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from the institutional ethics review board of Bombay Hospital (Regn. No: ECR/296/Inst/MH/2013; Date: 08/12/2021). Results A total of 768 patients were included. The mean overall survival rate was 35.2%, and it was higher in men than in women. The majority of patients belonged to a younger age group (&#x2264;18 years: 6.3%, 19-40 years: 47.7%, 41-60 years: 42.2%, &gt;60 years: 3.9%). The mean overall survival rate was higher in men (37.4%) than in women (28.4%). In the first year post-surgery, females experienced Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebrovascular Events (MACCE) at a rate of 11.1 person-years, while males had none. Among patients classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III, the incidence rate of MACCE was 2.7 person-years, whereas for NYHA class IV patients, it was 8.3 person-years. These trends persisted to some extent at the fifth year post-surgery. Conclusion Survival outcomes were influenced by factors such as age, sex, type of valve replacement, and NYHA class, with certain subgroups showing better survival rates. The first year post-surgery presented a higher incidence of MACCE, which declined over time. Mechanical valve replacement with appropriate anticoagulation can offer favorable long-term outcomes, particularly in younger patients. However, early postoperative risks, especially in women and those with advanced heart failure, highlight the need for individualized care and close monitoring. Future research should aim to refine patient selection, explore sex-based outcome disparities, and optimize anticoagulation strategies to further improve survival and quality of life in this population."},{"mesh_descriptors":[],"pmid":"40453154","title":"Obstructive Pharyngo-Laryngeal Hematoma Complicating Oral Anticoagulation: Case Report.","abstract":"Spontaneous pharyngo-laryngeal hematoma in patients receiving oral anticoagulants is rare and potentially fatal because of upper airway obstruction.

This study evaluated vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulation control during the last year of life, using nationwide data from Statistics Netherlands, linked to anticoagulation clinics' data and the Netherlands Cancer Registry. We included prevalent VKA users who were hospitalized with a severe medical condition and died between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2019. Anticoagulation control was assessed using time in therapeutic range (TTR), time above therapeutic range (TAR), and time below therapeutic range (TBR) and the international normalized ratio (INR) variance growth rate (VGR), which reflects INR variability. Anticoagulation control was examined by two approaches: (1) over four intervals (0-12 months, 0-9 months, 0-6 months, and 0-3 months preceding death), and (2) in 3-month intervals (9-12, 6-9, 3-6, and 0-3 months before death) to describe temporal changes. Among 6874 VKA users in their last year of life (median age 82 [Interquartile range: 76-87] years, 46.9% female), the most prevalent severe medical conditions were heart disease (60.4%), cancer (16.2%), and hip fracture (15.2%). As death approached, TTR and TBR decreased, while TAR and mean VGR increased, particularly in the last 3 months of life. This decline was more pronounced in cancer patients and acenocoumarol users. In conclusion, the quality of VKA anticoagulation declined in the last year of life in severely ill patients, marked by reduced TTR and increased TAR and VGR, suggesting an increased bleeding risk. These findings highlight the importance of reassessing VKA use and considering discontinuation in patients approaching the end of life."},{"mesh_descriptors":[{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Humans"},{"qualifiers":["statistics &amp; numerical data"],"descriptor":"International Normalized Ratio"},{"qualifiers":["antagonists &amp; inhibitors"],"descriptor":"Vitamin K"},{"qualifiers":["administration &amp; dosage"],"descriptor":"Anticoagulants"},{"qualifiers":["epidemiology"],"descriptor":"Netherlands"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Male"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Female"},{"qualifiers":["statistics &amp; numerical data"],"descriptor":"Drug Prescriptions"},{"qualifiers":["methods"],"descriptor":"Pharmacoepidemiology"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Aged"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Middle Aged"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Aged, 80 and over"}],"pmid":"40389391","title":"Determining Drug Exposure Based on Medication Dispensing Data: A Validation Study of Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment Episodes Against INR Records.","abstract":"In pharmaco-epidemiological studies using vitamin K antagonist (VKA) exposure, constructing treatment episodes based on dispensed prescriptions is challenging, particularly due to the large variability in therapeutic dose."},{"mesh_descriptors":[],"pmid":"40230696","title":"Corrigendum: A pharmacogenetically-guided acenocoumarol dosing algorithm for Chilean patients: a discovery cohort study.","abstract":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2020.00325.]."},{"mesh_descriptors":[{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Humans"},{"qualifiers":["adverse effects","administration &amp; dosage"],"descriptor":"Acenocoumarol"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Aged"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Male"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Female"},{"qualifiers":["adverse effects","administration &amp; dosage"],"descriptor":"Anticoagulants"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Risk Factors"},{"qualifiers":["epidemiology"],"descriptor":"Drug Overdose"},{"qualifiers":["chemically induced","epidemiology"],"descriptor":"Hemorrhage"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Tunisia"},{"qualifiers":["drug therapy"],"descriptor":"Atrial Fibrillation"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"International Normalized Ratio"},{"qualifiers":["drug therapy"],"descriptor":"Venous Thromboembolism"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Retrospective Studies"}],"pmid":"40220367","title":"[Not Available].","abstract":"Anticoagulant therapy, often required in the elderly, is not without risk.

In the present study, we focused on the major cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and tested a relative activity factor (RAF) method to quantitatively predict in&#xa0;vivo hepatic intrinsic clearance (CL<sub>h,int,vivo</sub>) and fraction metabolized (f<sub>m</sub>) by the P450 isoforms directly from an in&#xa0;vitro recombinant P450 system. We selected multiple probe substrates for CYP1A2 (caffeine, tizanidine, phenacetin), CYP2C9 ((S)-acenocoumarol, glimepiride, lornoxicam, tolbutamide, (S)-warfarin), CYP2C19 ((S)-lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole), CYP2D6 (desipramine, metoprolol, nebivolol, tolterodine), and CYP3A4 (alprazolam, felodipine, midazolam, nisoldipine, sildenafil, triazolam) to calculate the representative RAF value for each P450 isoform based on the in&#xa0;vivo-to-in&#xa0;vitro clearance ratio of the multiple probe substrates. The most pronounced substrate dependency of the RAF values was noted for CYP3A4 (2698 [alprazolam] to 19073 [nisoldipine] pmol P450/kg). Using the geometric mean of the RAF values for each isoform, a within 3-fold prediction of the CL<sub>h,int,vivo</sub> was obtained for all the 11 test drugs, except glibenclamide, which is a known substrate of hepatic uptake transporters. The f<sub>m</sub> values of the responsible P450 isoform(s) could be well predicted for mexiletine, tamsulosin, risperidone, celecoxib, and glibenclamide. This simple, practical RAF method can be one of the useful nonclinical methods to estimate the CL<sub>h,int,vivo</sub> and f<sub>m</sub> mediated by the major P450 isoforms, which would promote earlier understanding of the impact of genetic polymorphisms and drug-drug interactions on the human pharmacokinetics of the substrate compounds. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The relative activity factor method has been used for extrapolating in&#xa0;vitro clearance from recombinant systems to liver microsomes, but this study utilized this method to predict in&#xa0;vivo hepatic clearance and fraction metabolized values. By applying relative activity factor values obtained from multiple probe substrates, this study was able to quantitatively predict the in&#xa0;vivo clearances mediated by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. This simple, practical method will help optimize metabolic clearances via the major cytochrome P450 isoforms in the nonclinical stages."},{"mesh_descriptors":[{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Humans"},{"qualifiers":["chemistry"],"descriptor":"Ginkgo biloba"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Female"},{"qualifiers":["chemically induced","epidemiology"],"descriptor":"Hemorrhage"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Male"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Middle Aged"},{"qualifiers":["adverse effects","pharmacology"],"descriptor":"Plant Extracts"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Aged"},{"qualifiers":["adverse effects"],"descriptor":"Anticoagulants"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Retrospective Studies"},{"qualifiers":["drug effects"],"descriptor":"Blood Coagulation"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Herb-Drug Interactions"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Drug Interactions"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Adult"},{"qualifiers":["adverse effects"],"descriptor":"Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Risk Factors"},{"qualifiers":["adverse effects"],"descriptor":"Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"},{"qualifiers":[],"descriptor":"Ginkgo Extract"}],"pmid":"40198642","title":"Impact of Ginkgo biloba drug interactions on bleeding risk and coagulation profiles: A comprehensive analysis.","abstract":"This retrospective observational study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and clinical implications of drug interactions involving Ginkgo biloba extract on bleeding risk and coagulation profiles. Our analysis utilized data from patients admitted to Hai Phong International Hospital between January 2022 and December 2023. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients aged 18 years and above, those prescribed Ginkgo biloba extract alone or in combination with other medications, and the availability of complete medical records, including medication history, laboratory tests, and clinical outcomes. Out of 2,647 prescriptions meeting the inclusion criteria, 342 exhibited drug interactions with a prevalence rate of 12.94%. Notably, Ginkgo biloba extract frequent interacts with antiplatelets, anticoagulants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with Clopidogrel and Aspirin exhibiting the highest prevalence rates of 2.61% each. However, interactions with anticoagulants including direct oral anticoagulants and acenocoumarol, were not statistically significant in our analysis. Omeprazole was a frequently interacting drug (2.34%) of mild severity. Among the 747 patients analyzed for bleeding disorders, 31 (4.15%) exhibited bleeding symptoms. Correlation analysis indicated a strong association between clinical bleeding and abnormal coagulation results (OR, 1.75; p &lt;&#x2009; 0.001).

Nonetheless, its therapeutic efficacy is frequently hindered by resistance to tumor cell apoptosis induced by inter-radiotherapy. Induction of multiple cell death modalities provides a potential solution to this challenge. Ferroptosis, a distinct form of cell death from apoptosis, is dependent on the intracellular Fe<sup>2+</sup>-mediated Fenton reaction for the production of hydroxyl radicals (&#xb7;OH) and is gaining recognition as a promising approach for cancer treatment. In this study, we synthesized a therapeutic radionuclide iodine-131 (<sup>131</sup>I)-based TARE agent by combining <sup>131</sup>I-labeled iron-based MIL-88B(Fe) nanoparticles (NPs) (abbreviated as <sup>131</sup>I-MIL-88B(Fe)) with Lipiodol to achieve a combined apoptosis-ferroptosis tumor therapy. Specifically, a mixture of Lipiodol and <sup>131</sup>I-MIL-88B(Fe) NPs was injected into the liver tumors through the hepatic artery. Lipiodol blocks the arterial blood supply of the tumor, causing tumor tissue necrosis, whereas <sup>131</sup>I inter-radiotherapy damages deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) through direct action or indirectly via the production of &#xb7;OH through H<sub>2</sub>O radiolysis, leading to tumor cell apoptosis.

Furthermore, ABC, MATE, and MFS transporters were identified as crucial for the transmembrane transport of STZ by microalgae. A plausible biotransformation pathway for STZ degradation was proposed, identifying hydroxylation, oxidation, ring cleavage, and formylation as the primary transformation processes. The up-regulation of key enzymes such as monooxygenases, dioxygenases, hydrolases, and transferases suggested their pivotal role in the biodegradation of STZ.

Herein, the copper(III) periodate was synthesized to investigate the reactivity towards six sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) including typical two pentacyclic structures (sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and sulfathiazole (STZ)) and four hexacyclic structures (sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamerazine (SMR), sulfamonomethoxine (SMM) and sulfapyridine (SPD)).

Activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) drive the complex interactions within the TME, resulting in a microenvironment that is resistant to chemotherapy and tolerant to the immune system, thereby promoting tumor growth. Effective deactivation of PSC is vital in treating pancreatic cancer. However, previous studies have only focused on limited changes in PSC phenotype without comprehensively analysing their overall function. Our transcriptome analysis identified agents capable of modulating multiple biological functions of PSC, including fibrosis, extracellular matrix generation, and the secretion of cytokines and immune factors. Through this comprehensive assessment, we discovered that flumethasone (Flu) effectively deactivates PSC. This glucocorticoid analogue remodels the tumor microenvironment by regulating the secretomes of PSC and their interaction with tumor cells. Additionally, our research revealed that activated PSC exhibited heightened albumin endocytosis. As a result, we propose that albumin conjugation could serve as an effective targeted drug delivery approach for PSC.

The findings revealed that subjecting ET-22 and BL-99 to thermal treatment ranging from 70 &#xb0;C to 121 &#xb0;C for a duration of 10 min effectively deactivated them, leading to the disruption of cellular structure and release of intracellular contents.

However, excessive heating at 121 &#xb0;C diminished the antioxidant activity of the postbiotic. To further investigate the impact of thermal treatments on chemical composition, non-targeted metabolomics was conducted to analyze the cell-free supernatants derived from ET-22 and BL-99.

LHON has incomplete penetrance, with a higher prevalence in men, and its diagnosis is often delayed because of clinical overlap with other optic nerve disorders, such as optic neuritis. Herein, we report the case of a 37-year-old man presenting with progressive vision loss in both eyes over two months. Early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were suggestive of optic neuritis or peripapillary optic neuritis. Based on the MRI findings, the differential diagnoses for the patient's condition included multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-related diseases, sarcoidosis, Beh&#xe7;et's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj&#xf6;gren's syndrome, and idiopathic optic neuritis and peripapillary optic neuritis. The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and plasmapheresis. Despite immunotherapy, the patient's symptoms worsened. Comprehensive evaluation revealed normal cerebrospinal fluid and negative autoimmune markers. Mitochondrial DNA testing confirmed the m.11778G&gt;A mutation, which led to the diagnosis of LHON.

His vision stabilized at 0.3 in the right eye, whereas the left eye became completely blind. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of LHON, particularly when MRI findings mimic optic neuritis. The preservation of the pupillary light reflex and nonresponse to immunotherapy are key diagnostic clues.

Patient exposure to a drug between 3-months prior to the pandemic and the COVID-19 diagnosis was chosen as the exposure of interest. All-cause of death was selected as the primary outcome. Hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit, and need for mechanical ventilation were identified as secondary outcomes. Overall, 17 drugs were significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 severity. Previous exposure to two types of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, PCV13 (odds ratio (OR), 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.12-0.81 and OR, 0.33, 95% CI, 0.15-0.73), diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.38, 95% CI, 0.15-0.93) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of death (primary outcome).

There is an urgent need for novel antimicrobial agents or therapy strategies to manage infections caused by these notorious pathogens. In this study, we screened a collection of compounds that can dissipate bacterial proton motive force (PMF) and intermediate metabolites that can suppress antibiotic tolerance, and identified an antifungal drug sulconazole which can act in combination with glucose or trehalose to exert strong antibacterial effect against starvation-induced CR-hvKP persisters. Investigation of underlying mechanisms showed that sulconazole alone caused dissipation of transmembrane PMF, and sulconazole used in combination with glucose or trehalose could significantly inhibit the efflux activity, reduce NADH and ATP levels, and cause intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CR-hvKP persisters, eventually resulting in bacterial cell death.

The repositioning of drug function provides new ideas for the research and development of anticancer drugs. We previously showed that the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug sulconazole can effectively inhibit the growth of esophageal cancer cells, but its molecular mechanism is not clear. Here, our study demonstrated that sulconazole had a broad spectrum of anticancer effects. It can not only inhibit the proliferation but also inhibit the migration of esophageal cancer cells. Both transcriptomic sequencing and proteomic sequencing showed that sulconazole could promote various types of programmed cell death and inhibit glycolysis and its related pathways. Experimentally, we found that sulconazole induced apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis. Mechanistically, sulconazole triggered mitochondrial oxidative stress and inhibited glycolysis.

Furthermore, SN treatment reduces histone biotinylation, histone acetylation, and expression of superenhancer-associated GSC critical genes, which are also observed when biotin distribution is genetically disrupted by holocarboxylase synthetase (<i>HLCS</i>) depletion. <i>HLCS</i> silencing impaired GSC tumorigenicity in an orthotopic xenograft brain tumor model.

There is an urgent need for novel antimicrobial agents or therapy strategies to manage infections caused by these notorious pathogens. In this study, we screened a collection of compounds that can dissipate bacterial proton motive force (PMF) and intermediate metabolites that can suppress antibiotic tolerance, and identified an antifungal drug sulconazole which can act in combination with glucose or trehalose to exert strong antibacterial effect against starvation-induced CR-hvKP persisters. Investigation of underlying mechanisms showed that sulconazole alone caused dissipation of transmembrane PMF, and sulconazole used in combination with glucose or trehalose could significantly inhibit the efflux activity, reduce NADH and ATP levels, and cause intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CR-hvKP persisters, eventually resulting in bacterial cell death.
