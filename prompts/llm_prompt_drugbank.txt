LLama Prompt Template for DrugBank Indication Field Extraction
===============================================================

Source: Thera drug indication extraction system
Files: drugbank_extractor.jl (hypothetical)
Model: Llama 3.2
Purpose: Extract and normalize therapeutic indications from DrugBank indication text fields

PROMPT TEMPLATE:
================

You are a medical expert specializing in pharmaceutical data analysis and indication extraction.

DRUG: {DRUG_NAME}

DRUGBANK INDICATION TEXT:
{INDICATION_TEXT}

Task: Analyze the provided DrugBank indication text and extract individual therapeutic indications. Parse the text to identify specific medical conditions, diseases, or therapeutic uses mentioned.

Rules:
1. Extract each distinct medical condition or therapeutic indication mentioned
2. Normalize medical terminology to standard disease names
3. Focus on therapeutic uses, not pharmacological mechanisms or contraindications
4. Rate confidence 0.1-1.0 based on how clearly each indication is stated in the text
5. A confidence of 0.6+ means the indication is clearly and explicitly stated

Format your response for each extracted indication exactly as:
Indication 1:
EVIDENCE: [YES or NO]
CONFIDENCE: [0.1-1.0]
REASONING: [normalized condition/disease name - Context from DrugBank text]

Indication 2:
EVIDENCE: [YES or NO]
CONFIDENCE: [0.1-1.0]
REASONING: [normalized condition/disease name - Context from DrugBank text]

Continue for all therapeutic indications found in the text...

INPUT DATA FORMAT:
==================

Drug name and indication text from DrugBank database:

{DRUG_NAME} - The specific drug being analyzed (e.g., "Levothyroxine")
{INDICATION_TEXT} - Raw indication text from DrugBank indication field

Example DrugBank indication text:
"For the treatment of hypothyroidism as replacement or supplemental therapy in congenital or acquired hypothyroidism of any etiology, except transient hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis."

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS:
=========================

- Model: llama3.2
- Confidence Threshold: 0.6 (for clearly stated indications)
- Processing Approach: Text parsing and normalization of DrugBank indication fields
- Data Source: DrugBank XML indication field content
- Output Format: Structured evidence-confidence-reasoning triplets

EXAMPLE VARIABLES:
==================

{DRUG_NAME} - "Levothyroxine"
{INDICATION_TEXT} - "For the treatment of hypothyroidism as replacement or supplemental therapy in congenital or acquired hypothyroidism of any etiology, except transient hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis."

Expected Output Format:
Indication 1:
EVIDENCE: YES
CONFIDENCE: 1.0
REASONING: Hypothyroidism - Primary treatment indication explicitly stated for replacement therapy

Indication 2:
EVIDENCE: YES
CONFIDENCE: 0.9
REASONING: Congenital hypothyroidism - Specifically mentioned as indication for supplemental therapy

Indication 3:
EVIDENCE: YES
CONFIDENCE: 0.9
REASONING: Acquired hypothyroidism - Explicitly included in treatment scope

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
==================

- Text-based parsing approach using structured DrugBank data
- Confidence scoring reflects clarity and explicitness of indication statement
- Focus on therapeutic applications mentioned in official indication text
- Medical terminology normalization for consistency
- Structured output format enables automated parsing and validation
- EVIDENCE field reflects presence of indication in DrugBank text

OPTIMIZATION FEATURES:
======================

- Single-query efficiency per drug indication text
- Structured data source from authoritative database
- Immediate results generation from existing text
- Built-in confidence assessment based on text clarity
- Normalized medical terminology output
- Compatible with automated parsing systems
- Leverages official pharmaceutical indication data
