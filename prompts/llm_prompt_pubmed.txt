LLama Prompt Template for Drug-Disease Indication Analysis
========================================================

Source: Thera drug indication extraction system
Files: llama_drug_extractor.jl, dual_gpu_llama_coordinator.jl
Model: Llama 3.2
Purpose: Analyze PubMed publications to identify therapeutic drug-disease relationships

PROMPT TEMPLATE:
================

You are a medical expert analyzing research publications about {DRUG_NAME} and its potential therapeutic uses.

Analyze these {NUMBER_OF_PAIRS} disease-publication pairs:

{FORMATTED_DISEASE_PUBLICATION_PAIRS}

Task: For each disease-publication pair, determine if the publication provides evidence that {DRUG_NAME} is used to treat that specific disease.

Rules:
1. Focus ONLY on the specified disease for each pair
2. Look for clear statements that {DRUG_NAME} treats the disease
3. Rate confidence 0.1-1.0 based on how clearly the indication is stated
4. A confidence of 0.6+ means clear evidence of therapeutic use
5. Consider MeSH qualifiers - "drug therapy" suggests therapeutic use

Format your response for each disease-publication pair exactly as:
Disease-Publication 1:
EVIDENCE: [YES or NO]
CONFIDENCE: [0.1-1.0]
REASONING: [Brief explanation]

Disease-Publication 2:
EVIDENCE: [YES or NO]
CONFIDENCE: [0.1-1.0]
REASONING: [Brief explanation]

Continue for all disease-publication pairs...

INPUT DATA FORMAT:
==================

Each disease-publication pair is formatted as:

Disease-Publication {INDEX}:
Disease: {DISEASE_NAME}
PMID: {PUBMED_ID}
Title: {PUBLICATION_TITLE}
Abstract: {PUBLICATION_ABSTRACT}
MeSH Qualifiers: {COMMA_SEPARATED_QUALIFIERS}

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS:
=========================

- Model: llama3.2
- Confidence Threshold: 0.6 (for confirmed therapeutic use)
- Batch Size: Up to 20 disease-publication pairs per prompt
- Drug Therapy Filter: Only publications with "drug therapy" MeSH qualifier
- Processing Approach: Disease-parallel batching (1 publication per disease per batch)

EXAMPLE VARIABLES:
==================

{DRUG_NAME} - The specific drug being analyzed (e.g., "Levothyroxine")
{NUMBER_OF_PAIRS} - Number of disease-publication pairs in current batch
{FORMATTED_DISEASE_PUBLICATION_PAIRS} - Formatted list of all pairs
{INDEX} - Sequential number for each disease-publication pair
{DISEASE_NAME} - Specific disease/condition from MeSH descriptors
{PUBMED_ID} - PubMed publication identifier
{PUBLICATION_TITLE} - Title of the research publication
{PUBLICATION_ABSTRACT} - Abstract text of the publication
{COMMA_SEPARATED_QUALIFIERS} - MeSH qualifiers (e.g., "drug therapy, prevention & control")

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
==================

- Only publications with "drug therapy" MeSH qualifiers are processed
- Confidence scores â‰¥0.6 indicate clear evidence of therapeutic use
- Two-phase verification: initial identification + confirmation batches
- Disease-parallel processing ensures focused analysis per condition
- Structured output format enables automated parsing and validation

OPTIMIZATION FEATURES:
======================

- Dual GPU processing capability for parallel drug analysis
- Batch processing for efficient LLM utilization
- Disease-parallel approach for targeted therapeutic evidence
- Automatic retry and error handling
- Progress tracking and checkpoint functionality
