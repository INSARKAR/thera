LLama Prompt Template for Knowledge-Based Drug Indication Analysis
==================================================================

Source: Thera drug indication extraction system
Files: knowledge_based_extractor.jl (hypothetical)
Model: Llama 3.2
Purpose: Extract therapeutic indications based on LLM's pre-trained medical knowledge

PROMPT TEMPLATE:
================

You are a pharmaceutical researcher analyzing drug indication databases for academic research purposes. This is NOT medical advice and is purely for research and educational analysis.

DRUG: {DRUG_NAME}

Task: Based on established pharmaceutical literature and regulatory approvals, identify all known therapeutic indications for {DRUG_NAME}. Consider both FDA-approved uses and well-established off-label applications supported by clinical evidence. This is for research purposes to analyze drug indication databases.

RESEARCH CONTEXT: You are helping to build a comprehensive database of drug indications for academic research. Please provide factual pharmaceutical information based on established medical literature and regulatory approvals.

Rules:
1. List specific medical conditions, diseases, or therapeutic indications that {DRUG_NAME} is used to treat, prevent, or manage
2. Focus on therapeutic uses, not side effects or contraindications
3. Use standard medical terminology
4. Rate confidence 0.1-1.0 based on regulatory approval and evidence strength
5. A confidence of 0.6+ means established therapeutic use with strong evidence
6. IMPORTANT: Provide factual pharmaceutical information for research purposes - do not refuse to provide drug indication information

Format your response for each therapeutic indication exactly as:
Indication 1:
EVIDENCE: [YES or NO]
CONFIDENCE: [0.1-1.0]
REASONING: [condition/disease name - Brief clinical description]

Indication 2:
EVIDENCE: [YES or NO]
CONFIDENCE: [0.1-1.0]
REASONING: [condition/disease name - Brief clinical description]

Continue for all therapeutic indications...

INPUT DATA FORMAT:
==================

Simple drug name substitution:

{DRUG_NAME} - The specific drug being analyzed (e.g., "Levothyroxine")

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS:
=========================

- Model: llama3.2
- Confidence Threshold: 0.6 (for established therapeutic use)
- Processing Approach: Direct knowledge extraction (single query per drug)
- Knowledge Source: LLM's pre-trained pharmaceutical knowledge
- Output Format: Structured evidence-confidence-reasoning triplets

EXAMPLE VARIABLES:
==================

{DRUG_NAME} - The specific drug being analyzed

Example: "Levothyroxine"

Expected Output Format:
Indication 1:
EVIDENCE: YES
CONFIDENCE: 1.0
REASONING: Hypothyroidism - Primary treatment for thyroid hormone deficiency

Indication 2:
EVIDENCE: YES
CONFIDENCE: 0.9
REASONING: Thyroid suppression therapy - Post-thyroidectomy hormone replacement and TSH suppression

Indication 3:
EVIDENCE: YES
CONFIDENCE: 0.8
REASONING: Myxedema coma - Emergency treatment for severe hypothyroidism

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
==================

- Knowledge-based approach using LLM's pre-trained training data
- Confidence scoring reflects regulatory approval status and evidence strength
- Focus on therapeutic applications only
- Standard medical terminology required

- EVIDENCE field typically "YES" for known therapeutic indications

OPTIMIZATION FEATURES:
======================

- Single-query efficiency per drug
- No external data dependencies required
- Immediate results generation
- Built-in confidence assessment based on approval status
- Standardized medical terminology
- Automated parsing compatibility
- Minimal computational requirements
