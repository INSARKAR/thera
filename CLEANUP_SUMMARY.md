# Directory Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

✅ **Organized Project Structure**
- Created logical directory hierarchy
- Moved scripts to appropriate subdirectories
- Archived old and deprecated files
- Cleaned up temporary files

✅ **Updated .gitignore**
- Comprehensive coverage for all file types
- Organized by categories
- Includes large data directories
- Covers HPC/SLURM specific files

✅ **Created New README**
- Modern, comprehensive documentation
- Clear project structure overview
- Usage examples and troubleshooting
- HPC/SLURM specific guidance

## New Directory Structure

```

## Files Successfully Organized

### Scripts Moved to `scripts/`
- SLURM job scripts → `scripts/slurm/`
- Extraction scripts → `scripts/extraction/`
- Monitoring scripts → `scripts/monitoring/`
- Setup scripts → `scripts/setup/`

### Documentation Moved to `docs/`
- README files → `docs/usage/`
- Implementation guides → `docs/implementation/`
- Summary documents → `docs/summaries/`

### Tests Moved to `tests/`
- Test scripts → `tests/unit/`
- Debug scripts → `tests/debug/`
- Validation scripts → `tests/integration/`

### Configuration Moved to `config/`
- Config files → `config/`
- Environment files → `config/`

### Archives Created
- Old versions → `archive/old_versions/`
- Deprecated code → `archive/deprecated/`

## Git Status

The `.gitignore` now properly excludes:
- Large data directories (`drug_pubmed_refs/`, `llama_pubmed_extracted_indications/`)
- Log files and temporary outputs
- SLURM job files
- Archive directories
- Editor and OS specific files
- Model files and caches

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Organization**: Logical separation of concerns
2. **Cleaner Repository**: Proper gitignore reduces repo size
3. **Easier Navigation**: Clear directory structure
4. **Better Maintenance**: Separated current from archived code
5. **Professional Appearance**: Modern documentation and structure
6. **HPC Ready**: Proper organization for SLURM workflows

## Next Steps

1. The directory is now clean and properly organized
2. The fresh Levothyroxine extraction job is still running
3. All scripts are in their proper locations
4. Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date

The project is now ready for production use with a clean, professional structure that will be easy to maintain and extend.
